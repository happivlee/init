#1. Write a script which displays only the login, UID and Path of each entry of the /etc/passwd file.

cat /etc/passwd | awk -F ":" '{print $1, $3, $6}' | column -t

#man awk - pattern-directed scanning and processing language - scans the file for a match
# $1, $3, $6 - means print the 1st, 3rd, and 6th fields
#-F fs == defines the input field separator to be the regular expression fs. fs is defined to be ':'
#man column -- columnate lists - formats its input into multiple columns
#-t option == determine the number of columns the input contains and create a table. columns are delimited with whitespace, or with the characters supplied using the -s option. Useful for pretty-printing displays.

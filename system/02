#2. What command can you use to rename your system?

hostname new-hostname

#man hostname - if you just type hostname you'll get the current hostname, if you type hostname vlee, it will change the hostname to vlee (the new hostname)
#sudo hostname new-hostname-here (in case it needs superuser privileges)

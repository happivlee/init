#8. What file contains the RSA keys of systems that are authorized to connect via SSH?

cat /etc/ssh/

#ssh_host_rsa_key is an example of an authorized rsa key. ssh_host_rsa_key.pub is another one

#shows where the rsa keys are located
#cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config should also work
# can also use "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" - works with the right extensions added.
